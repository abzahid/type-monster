        <P class="questions">***1. What is the difference between local storage and session storage ?</P>
        <p>
            Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the
            stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets
            cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private”
            tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito
            session).

            Session Storage: Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
            difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
            sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

            The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data
            is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the
            browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.</p>

        <P class="questions">***2. What is the difference between global scope and block scope ?</P>
        <p>
            Global Scope: In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in,
            all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the
            code is being executed.

            Block Scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the
            outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.

            In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
            controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements,
            and the like.</p>

        <P class="questions">***3. How does the event loop work in javascript?</P>
        <p>
            Event Loop: The Event Loop has one simple job-to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
            Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
            which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. JavaScript has a runtime
            model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events,
            and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and
            Java.</p>

        <P class="questions">***4.Why we can get undifined?</P>
        <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
            undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
            undefined if a value was not returned. </p>
